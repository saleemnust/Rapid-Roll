# Rapid-Roll
Rules If you want to remain alive you have to stay on the bars and remain in sight. Beyond the screen there is death waiting for you.  But remember, not all bars are friendly. code details,  our code is in opengl, all libraries, textures, etc already added,  no need to add any other extra library, anyone can open the opengl basic file in the project and run the game.
